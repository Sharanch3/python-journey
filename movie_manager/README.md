# 🎬 Movie Manager (CLI Project)

A simple **command-line application** to manage your personal collection of movies.  
You can add new movies, list all saved movies, and search for a movie by its title.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Keeping track of movies you have watched or plan to watch can be challenging.  
People often write them down on paper or forget them altogether.  
This project provides a lightweight **text-based movie manager** that helps users:

- Save movie details (title, director, year).
- View the entire collection at any time.
- Search for a specific movie by title.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add new movies with details like **title**, **director**, and **release year**.
- Display all saved movies in a clean format.
- Search and display a movie by its title.
- Simple menu-driven interface.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Data is stored **only in memory** (RAM).  
  ➝ When you quit the program, all saved movies are lost.  
- No ability to update or delete movies once added.  
- No advanced features like sorting, ratings, or genres.  
- Limited to running in the **Python console** (not a GUI or web app).

# 🐍 My Python Journey  

Welcome to my **Python Journey Repository**! 🚀  

This repo is a collection of the projects, exercises, and experiments I’ve been working on while learning Python step by step. It documents my growth from the basics all the way to advanced concepts in programming and data science.

## 📂 Repository Structure  

- Each folder contains a **set of Python codes** I’ve written.  
- Inside each folder, you’ll also find a **`README.md` file** explaining the purpose of the code, key concepts, and what I learned while building it.  
- Think of this repo as my **learning diary in code** — every file marks a milestone in my journey.

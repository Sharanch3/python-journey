# Simple Bill Splitter ðŸ’¸ðŸ‘«

## Problem Statement

Splitting a bill among friends can sometimes be confusing, especially when the total amount is not evenly divisible or when you want to avoid calculation errors. This Python program solves that problem by calculating each person's share of the bill and displaying it in a clean, readable format. It works for any number of people and rounds the amount to 2 decimal places for convenience.

# ðŸŽ¤ Self-Intro Script Generator

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Many people struggle with writing a simple but engaging self-introduction, whether for an event, a class, or even a friendly setting.  
The challenge is to create a **Python script** that interacts with the user and generates a **personalized self-introduction paragraph** in a clear, warm, and readable format.  

This script should:  
1. Ask the user for their **name, age, city, profession, and favorite hobby**.  
2. Format these inputs into a **friendly introduction paragraph**.  
3. Display the final introduction inside a decorative border for better presentation.  
4. Include the **current date** to indicate when the introduction was generated.

## EXAMPLE ðŸ§¾
If the user inputs:
  Name: Priya
  Age: 22
  City: Jaipur
  Profession: Software Developer
  Hobby: playing guitar

Your script might output:
  "Hello! My name is Priya. I'm 22 years old and live in Jaipur. I work as a Software Developer and I absolutely enjoy playing guitar in my free time. Nice to meet you!"

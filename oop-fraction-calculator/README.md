# âž— Fraction Class in Python

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
In mathematics, fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. Performing arithmetic operations on fractions 
(addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) manually is tedious and error-prone.

The goal of this project is to build a Python class `Fraction` that models fractions and allows direct 
arithmetic operations using operator overloading (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). 
This mimics real-world fraction manipulation while leveraging the power of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Represents fractions using a `numerator` and `denominator`
- Supports the following operations:
  - `+` (Addition)
  - `-` (Subtraction)
  - `*` (Multiplication)
  - `/` (Division)
- Displays fractions in a human-readable format (`3/4`, `1/2`, etc.)
- Uses OOP concepts like:
  - Parameterized constructors
  - Dunder methods (`__str__`, `__add__`, `__sub__`, etc.)
  - Operator overloading

## ðŸŽ“ Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

1. âœ… Understand how to define and use **class** in Python.  
2. âœ… Learn about **constructors (`__init__`)** and how they initialize objects.  
3. âœ… Explore **dunder methods (`__str__`, `__add__`, etc.)** for customizing object behavior.  
4. âœ… Practice **operator overloading** to perform arithmetic with custom objects.  
5. âœ… Gain experience in **object-oriented problem solving** (modeling real-world fractions).  
6. âœ… Improve code readability and reusability using **OOP principles**.  
7. âœ… Strengthen your ability to build **mathematical models in code**.
